These are only suggested configurations. To give you a starting point for your configs. 

Do not make changes to the default_config file unless you know what you're doing. If you do decide to tweak it, please copy it so you can revert changes if needed. 

The best way is to copy whatever configuration changes from the default_config into the user_config since any values in the user_config will override the default_config when the program runs. This means you should never need to change the default_config. 

I've kept my user_config pretty basic and I've kept the default_config as is. Should you want to edit your user_config with advanced settings you can find those advanced settings inside the default_config. 

The files in the "suggested_scheduling_configs" folder have suggested values for different scheduler combinations **ONLY**.
  
Simple replace in line or completely your user_config yaml with the suggested config. Tweak as needed. 

If you decide to replace in line your current file, simply set the weights to 0.0 for any current ones that you're using, or you could comment out the lines that you don't use. 
  
If you're happy with your current user_config, I'd recommend you simply make a copy of it, and then tweak the user_config by copying the files in whole. That way is the easiest and cleanest way to ensure you don't delete things that work and you can play around with other values.
