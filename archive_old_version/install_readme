install_simple_kes.py #this file contains the code necessary to read the requirements.txt file and install necessary dependancies, as well as download the scheduler files and config.
install_simple_kes.bat #This file runs the install_simple_kes.py file which will install the requirements into the venv folder (if found) or into the 'fallback_venv_path' which is "simple_kes_requirements". Move from the modules from fallback_venv_path to your venv folder if it does not install into "venv". It executes the code in the install_simple_kes.py file.
Install the above files into the root folder where you have installed Stable Diffusion. It should be located in the same location as webui.bat.


1. Run install_simple_kes.bat to install the dependancies, and download the scheduler, config, and requirements into their respective folders. 
2. Ensure that sd_schedulers.py has been updated with the lines inside the Readme file under "setup". It is located inside ./modules/
3. Ensure that simple_karras_exponential_scheduler.py is inside the modules folder, and and simple_kes_scheduler.yaml is inside the modules/kes_config folder.
4. Enjoy!

Ensure that you run install_simple_kes.bat or run from cmd: Python install_simple_kes.py , as this will execute the installation of requirements into the venv folder.

For troubleshooting "watchdog" see troubleshoot_watchdog . Essentially, you can try to reinstall all your requirements. Ensure that you merge the simple_kes_requirements.txt (install location is ./modules/kes_config) to the requirements.txt file, and then run the A1111 setup.
