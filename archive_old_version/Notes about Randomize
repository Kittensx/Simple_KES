Notes about randomize:

If randomize is true -- all the options underneath are randomized. This means that changing each value to true will not affect the randomizer working.

If randomize is false - it checks each value underneath. If any of those values are true, it randomizes only those values. 

If all values underneath randomize are false, then it will revert to using the values above and ignore the min/max values.
