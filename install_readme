simple_kes_requirements.txt #additional modules required to run 
install_simple_kes.py #this file contains the code necessary to read the requirements.txt file and install necessary dependancies
install_simple_kes.bat #This file runs the install_simple_kes.py file which will install the requirements into the venv folder (if found) or into the 'fallback_venv_path' which is "simple_kes_requirements". Move from the modules from fallback_venv_path to your venv folder if it does not install into "venv"
Install the above files into the root folder where you have installed Stable Diffusion. It should be located in the same location as webui.bat.


1. Run install_simple_kes.bat to install the dependancies. 
2. Ensure that sd_schedulers.py has been updated and is located inside ./modules/
3. Ensure that simple_karras_exponential_scheduler.py and simple_kes_scheduler.yaml are inside the modules folder.

For troubleshooting "watchdog" see troubleshoot_watchdog . Essentially, you can try to reinstall all your requirements. Ensure that you add the simple_kes_requirements to the requirements.txt file.
